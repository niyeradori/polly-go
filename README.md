GO client library for AWS Polly API

First I would like to admit that I am new to Go. 

We were using Ivona API. When Amazon made the Polly API announcement a few weeks ago, we were eager to try it, but could not find Polly Library for Go. So I made this quick wrapper.

I would like to acknowledge and thank Jose Padilla(https://github.com/jpadilla) for his ivona-go(https://github.com/jpadilla/ivona-go) library without which I could not have hacked this with in a few hours on a Sunday evening and have our demo working for Monday.

To run the code you will need AWS access key and secret code. 

Installation
go get github.com/niyeradori/polly-go
